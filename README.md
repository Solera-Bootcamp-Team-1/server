Our RESTful API

## How does this work
There are two files (teams.json and tasks.json) on the root directory.
Two data classes (POJOs) are used to serialize and deserialize their contents.

## API documentation
- `/tasks` returns an array of all the tasks.
- `/teams` returns an array of all the teams.
